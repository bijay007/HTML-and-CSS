This contains my personal website with stuffs I have self-studied. I will try to make it as packed as possible while learning new things everyday. I will certainly do my 100% to convert it into an awesome project :)
UPDATE : development paused for the moment...need to work on my CSS and hardcore problem-solving skills.I will be doing algorithms challenges and algorith development with js for now along with bootstrap course in coursera/udacity.
